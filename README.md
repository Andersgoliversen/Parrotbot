# Parrotbot

Parrotbot is a small web based chatbot that repeats whatever you write back to you. The response alternates between upper case and lower case characters and ends with exclamation marks.

## Usage

Open `indexParrot.html` in your browser. Click the **Parrotbot** button to open the chat window. Type a message and press **Enter** or click the send icon to receive a response.

## Development

The behaviour of the bot is implemented in `parrotScript.js`. Styling rules are in `chatbot.css`. Background images used by the page are stored in the `images` directory.

No external build step is required; simply open the HTML file in a modern browser.
